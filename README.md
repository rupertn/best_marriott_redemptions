# Which North American Marriott Properties Offer the Best Points Redemption Value?

The purpose of this project was to help members of Marriott Bonvoy, the loyalty program of the Marriott Hotel chain, extract the most value from their loyalty points when redeeming them for hotel stays. In this context, points value is defined as the ratio between the number of points required to redeem for a hotel stay divided by the cost of purchasing the same room on the same night with cash. A more in depth explanation of this concept, and the project as a whole, is available at [pointsplanner.ca](pointsplanner.ca), a website I built to showcase the results of my analysis. 

### Project Highlights
  * Used the Amadeus Hotel Search API to collect hotel rates for almost 800 Marriott properties in the United States and Canada.
  * Parsed placemark data from a Google Maps kml file that contained property information for nearly all Marriott hotels globally.
  * Identified and removed statistical outliers from the hotel rates data using multiple outlier detection methods.
  * Developed a methodology for calculating the average points redemption value for each hotel.
  * Built [pointsplanner.ca](pointsplanner.ca) using the Bootstrap framework to discuss the analysis and present the findings in an interactive table.
