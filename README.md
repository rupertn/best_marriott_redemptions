# Which Marriott Properties Offer the Best Points Redemption Value?
### Project Highlights
  * Used the Amadeus Hotel Search API to collect hotel rates for almost 800 Marriott properties in the United States and Canada.
  * Parsed placemark data from a Google Maps kml file that contained property information for nearly all Marriott hotels globally.
  * Identified and removed statistical outliers from the hotel rates data using multiple outlier detection methods.
  * Developed a methodology for calculating the average points redemption value for each hotel.
  * Built [pointsplanner.ca](pointsplanner.ca) using the Bootstrap framework to discuss the analysis and present the findings in an interactive table.
