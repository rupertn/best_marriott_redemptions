# Which North American Marriott Properties Offer the Best Average Points Redemption Value?

The purpose of this project was to help members of Marriott Bonvoy, the loyalty program of the Marriott Hotel chain, extract the most value from their loyalty points when redeeming them for hotel stays. In this context, points value is defined as the cost of purchasing a hotel room with cash, divided by the number of loyalty points required to redeem for the same room. A more in-depth explanation of this concept, and the project as a whole, is available at [pointsplanner.ca](pointsplanner.ca), a website I built to showcase the results of this analysis.

### Project Highlights
  * Used the Amadeus Hotel Search API to collect hotel rates for almost 800 Marriott properties in the United States and Canada across 25 dates.
  * Parsed placemark data from a Google Maps kml file that contained property information for nearly all Marriott hotels globally.
  * Identified and removed statistical outliers from the hotel rates data using multiple outlier detection methods.
  * Developed a methodology for calculating the average points redemption value for each hotel.
  * Built [pointsplanner.ca](pointsplanner.ca) using the Bootstrap framework to discuss the analysis and present the findings in an interactive table.
